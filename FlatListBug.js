This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid or inconsistent data structure to the data prop.  The error message might not be very descriptive, leading to confusion. For instance, if your data array contains null or undefined elements, or if the structure of elements within the array changes unexpectedly, FlatList might throw this error without clearly indicating the exact cause.
